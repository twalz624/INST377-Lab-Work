Replace this with your complete HTML from Lab 1

Hook it up to CSS by including style.css in the <head> tag

Then add CSS class names to your HTML to make it look like the lab pictures.
For example: <div class="selector">

You should not need to edit the CSS to do this, only the HTML.

Don't forget to add an actual set of image descriptions to your image carousel.
